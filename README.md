## Matt Gough

I love solving problems and being creative. I studied Physics at university because I liked solving complex problems, but when the problems got so large you have to have PhD to begin to understand them, they lost their appeal. Twelve months ago I thought programming was dull and uncreative, of course I hadn't tried it. Now I'm amazed by it's creative and problem-solving capabilities. The [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/employers/) course I've just completed has been incredible and given me some fantastic skills to start my career as junior developer, and I can't wait to apply them.

## Skills

#### Group Work

Confident working in a group. Developed through intensive group work on the Makers Academy course, where we used Github Workflow and Waffle to manage tasks.

- Makers Academy Final Project - [Social-Dashboard](https://github.com/MattGough/Social-Dashboard), a dashboard for social media streams.
- Makers Academy Week 9 Group Project - [MakersBnb](https://github.com/MattGough/makers-bnb-ra), an Airbnb clone built with AngularJs and Ruby on Rails.

#### Software Craftsmanship

At Makers Academy I learnt the importance of Test Driven Development, adhering to SOLID principles and the strength of the AGILE development process. The AGILE process emphasized pair-programming which was implemented throughout the course, as well as daily stand-ups and weekly retrospectives.

- Here are some examples of unit tests using [RSpec](https://github.com/MattGough/bank_tech_test/blob/master/spec/account_spec.rb), [Jasmine](https://github.com/MattGough/Thermostat/blob/master/spec/ThermostatSpec.js) and [Karma](https://github.com/DouglasRose/Angular_Project/blob/master/test/unit/controllerSpec.js) and feature tests using [Capybara](https://github.com/MattGough/instagram-challenge/blob/master/spec/features/posts_feature_spec.rb) and [Protractor](https://github.com/MattGough/Social-Dashboard/blob/master/tests/e2e-tests/twitter_scenarios.js).
- In our Social-Dashboard project I refactored the logic for making API requests to a service which really slimed down our [controllers in AngularJS](https://github.com/MattGough/Social-Dashboard/commit/56bd14a89d770b260b5179ca8ff0365f095902ee)), and made adding API providers easier!

#### Ruby & Javascript

Through most of the Makers Academy course we focused on Ruby. We also learnt Javascript which I've grown to love coding in. Our final project, [Social-Dashboard](https://github.com/MattGough/Social-Dashboard), was written entirely in Javascript.

- A [yelp-clone](https://github.com/MattGough/yelp_clone) & an [instagram-clone](https://github.com/MattGough/instagram-challenge) built with Ruby on Rails.
- My Codewars [profile](http://www.codewars.com/users/Matt_Gough). (6kyu and dropping!)
- A web app that searches Github Users by name, built with AngularJS and Sinatra, and [deployed to Heroku](https://github-user-search123.herokuapp.com/).


#### Physics

During my degree I learnt to tackle complex problems such as Quantum Mechanics and Particle Physics. This has provided me with strong mathematical and analytical skills.

- I also produced scientific reports including this literature review on [Neutral Atom Detection](https://www.dropbox.com/s/w4d9wjygnkv2r3x/Neutral%20Atom%20Detection%20%28Matthew%20Gough%29.docx?dl=0).
