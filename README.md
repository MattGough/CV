## Matt Gough

[Makers Academy Ronin](http://ronin.makersacademy.com/) graduate starting my career as a software developer. I graduated from UCL, in September 2014 with a Physics BSc, I've since been enjoying some of my passions: running, cycling, & climbing in the mountains of North Wales. I'm looking to start a career as a junior developer with a great team, who are really passionate about writing great code and creating incredible things.

## Skills

#### Group Work

Confident working in a group; managing resources and time effectively. Comfortable taking a lead or supporting role. Developed through intensive group work on the Makers Academy course and in projects at university plus experience from retail jobs.

- Makers Academy Final Project - [Social-Dashboard](https://github.com/MattGough/Social-Dashboard), a dashboard for social media streams.
- Makers Academy Week 9 Group Project - [MakersBnb](https://github.com/MattGough/makers-bnb-ra), an airbnb clone built with AngularJs and Ruby on Rails.
- Third Year Degree Project - Using Bending Pre-Stress to Strengthen Structures ([Link to presentation](http://prezi.com/n-rhqgzdel5t/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share), voted best in year!)
- Experience in working in retail teams including at  [Morrisons](https://morissons.com), [Blacks](http://www.blacks.co.uk/), [Cotswold Outdoor](http://www.cotswoldoutdoor.com/), [Snowdon Mountain Railway](http://www.snowdonrailway.co.uk/).

#### Software Craftsmanship

At Makers Academy I learnt the importance of Test Driven Development, never writing code without a test first, adhering to SOLID principles and the strength of the AGILE development process.  The AGILE process emphasized pair-programming which was implemented throughout the course, as well as daily stand-ups and weekly retrospectives.

- Here are some examples of unit tests using RSpec and Jasmine and feature tests using Capybara and Protractor.
- This AngularJS [service](https://github.com/MattGough/Social-Dashboard/blob/master/app/services.js) from the Social-Dashboard project, although not perfect, opens the application up to api providers being easily added.

#### Ruby & Javascript

Through most of the Makers Academy course we focused on Ruby, which I now feel very comfortable using. We also learnt Javascript which I've grown to love coding in. Our final project, [Social-Dashboard](https://github.com/MattGough/Social-Dashboard), was written entirely in Javascript.

- A [yelp-clone](https://github.com/MattGough/yelp_clone) & an [instagram-clone](https://github.com/MattGough/instagram-challenge) built with Ruby on Rails.
- My Codewars [profile](http://www.codewars.com/users/Matt_Gough). (4kyu and dropping!)
- In our Social-Dashboard project I refactored the logic for making api requests to a service which really slimed down our [controllers](https://github.com/MattGough/Social-Dashboard/blob/master/app/controllers/twitter_controller.js) in AngularJS!


#### Physics

During my degree I learnt to tackle complex problems such as Quantum Mechanics and Particle Physics. This has provided me with strong mathematical and analytical skills.

- I also produced scientific reports including this literature review on Neutral Atom Detection and this report on a Hall-Effect experiment.
